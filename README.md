# Elephant, Stripe Clojure Client

Elephant is a fairly modern Clojure client for the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api).

## Project Goals

 * Provide an API that allows developers primarily work with immutable
Clojure data structures.
 * Have good test coverage.


## Project Maturity

Elephant is still relative young but the most active stage of development
is now behind us. Breaking public API changes are relatively unlikely.


## Artifacts

Elephant artifacts are [released to Clojars](https://clojars.org/clojurewerkz/elephant).
If you are using Maven, add the following repository
definition to your `pom.xml`:

``` xml
<repository>
  <id>clojars.org</id>
  <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
```

### The Most Recent Release

## Documentation & Examples

The project is too young to begin documenting the API.

## Development

Elephant uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make
sure you have it installed and then run tests against supported
Clojure versions using

    lein all test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done
with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request on GitHub.

## FAQ

### What's in the Name?

The library is inspired by a badass USSR cartoon about two detectives
investigating theft of a striped elephant.
